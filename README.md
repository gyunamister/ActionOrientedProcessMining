## 0. Overview

This ProM plugin implements **a general framework for action-oriented process mining** that supports the continuous management of operational processes and the automated execution of actions.

![IMAGE](resources/CEB75BA1663C64A4B4FE443C76B9920A.jpg)
This figure shows the overview of ActionOrientedProcessMining (**_AOPM_**) plug-in. It transforms the event stream, which is continuosly generated by information systems, into the action instance stream, which describes mitigating actions that needs to be applied in the information systems to improve the process.

More in detail, the **constraint monitor** evaluates a set of constraints, defined with various diagnostics, by analyzing the event stream. As a result, it generates a constraint instance stream that is the description of (non) violations of these constraints.By analyzing this constraint instance stream, the **action engine** assesses the necessity of actions and generates the actions ranging from process-level valves, instance-level adaptors and alerts.

- Section 1 explains the input and output of this plugin.
- Section 2 explains how to use this plugin.
- Section 3 introduces the experiemental enviornment to facilitate the test of this plugin and explains how to use the environment.
- Section 4 specifies the set of constraints that this plugin supports for the constraint monitor.
- Section 5 is an appendix to give further information on the inputs (i.e., *OCL*, *CFDL*, *AFDL*) and the output (i.e., *AIS*).

## 1. Input and Output

This plugin takes an **event stream**, a **constraint formula definition**, and an **action formula definition** as inputs. In return, it generates an **action instance stream**. Detailed information about input and output is as follows:

### Input

1. **Event stream**

- An event stream is in XML-based Object-Centric Log (*OCL*) format, storing object-centric events introduced in the paper. Each event may refer to different objects from different object classes. The Schema of *OCL* is described in Appendix.

- Example

  ```
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <event-stream>
  <event event-id="889923">
    <process-id>OH</process-id>
    <activity-id>place_order</activity-id>
    <resource-id>Jane</resource-id>
    <timestamp>1</timestamp>
    <object-mapping>
      <object-class type="Order">
        <object-id>o1</object-id>
      </object-class>
      <object-class type="Item">
        <object-id>i1</object-id>
        <object-id>i2</object-id>
      </object-class>
    </object-mapping>
  </event>
  </event-stream>
  ```

  "The event "889923" is about placing order *o1* containing items *i1* and *i2*. The order placement is done by *Jane* at Time *1*."

2. **Constraint Formula Definition (*CFD*)**

- The constraint formulas are defined by *Constraint Formula Definition Language (CFDL)*. The syntax is explained below. More information in the appendix.

  ```
  DEFINE <<contraint formula name>> AS
  CONTEXT <<context description>>
  EVALUATE <<predicate description>>
  ```

- Example

  ```
  DEFINE "cf1"  AS
  CONTEXT "omap"={"Order":{"foreach"}}
  EVALUATE "Throughput", <, 72;
  ```

  The above constraint formula represents that "*cf1*" is a constraint formula which evaluates "*if the throughput time of each order is less than 72 hours*". ```EVALUATE <<predicate description>>``` part decides which type of constraints we want to monitor. ***Section 4*** explains all types of constraints this plug-in supports.

3. **Action Formula Definition (*AFD*)**

- The action formulas are defined by *Action Formula Definition Language (AFDL)*. The syntax is explained below. More information in *Appendix*.

  ```
    DEFINE <<action formula name>> AS
    ANALYZE <<analysis description>>
    ASSESS <<predicate description>>
    OPERATION <<operation name>>
    PARAMTER <<parameter mapping description>>
  ```

- Example

  ```
  DEFINE "af1" AS
  ANALYZE "cf"={"cf1"} & "Order"={"foreach"}
  ASSESS "count",>,0
  OPERATION "Set higher priority"
  PARAMETER "target"="Order";
  ```

  The above action formula represents that "*af1*"is an action formula which generate a transaction regarding "Set higher priority" is there is any violation of *cf1* by any order.

### Output

- **Action Instance Stream (*AIS*)**

  - An action instance stream is in XML-based *AIS* format, storing action instances. The schema of *AIS* is described in *Appendix*.

  - Example

    ```
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <action-instance-stream>
    <action-instance>
      <action-formula>a1-set_higher-priority-for-delayed-orders</action-formula>
      <operation>Set_higher_priority</operation>
      <parameter-mapping>
        <parameter name="target">
          <value>Order</value>
        </parameter>
      </parameter-mapping>
      <timestamp>1</timestamp>
    </action-instance>
    </action-instance-stream>
    ```

## 3. Experimental environment

To facilitate the test of the framework, we provide an experimental environment with an information system simulating an order handling process.

#### Description about the process:

- There are 16 available resources in total at any time and each of them is responsible for multiple activities in the process.
- Orders are randomly placed, and queued for the resource allocation after each activity.
- The resource is allocated according to *First-in First-out* rule.

The figure below shows the overview of the experimental environment.

### Gateway and supporting transactions by the information system

The gateway parses the resulting AIS file and translate the action instances to the system-readable transactions. The following is the list of transactions that can be executed by the information system. In other words, if you define action formulas that conform to the following operations and parameters, you can experience the actual changes in the information system.

- **Process level (Valves)**

  - Task addition

  ```xml
  OPERATION "Add task"
  PARAMETER "task-id"=<task-identifier>, "preceded-by"=<preceding-task-identifier>,
  "followed-by"=<follwoing-task-id>
  ```

  - Task elimination

  ```xml
  OPERATION "Eleminate task"
  PARAMETER "task-id"=<task-identifier>, "preceded-by"=<preceding-task-identifier>,
  "followed-by"=<follwoing-task-id>
  ```

  - Change to SPT

  ```xml
  OPERATION "Change routing rule"
  PARAMETER "new-routing-rule"=<routing-rule-id>
  ```

  - Change maximum capacity

  ```xml
  OPERATION "Change maximum capacity"
  PARAMETER "change-rate"=<rate-value>
  ```

  - Add resource

  ```xml
  OPERATION "Add resource"
  PARAMETER "resource-id"=<resoure-identifier>, "target-task"=<task-identifier>
  ```

- **Instance level (Adaptors)**

  - Task cancellation

  ```xml
  OPERATION "Cancel the task"
  PARAMETER "target"=<object-identifer> "task-id"=<task-identifier>
  ```

  - Restart

  ```xml
  OPERATION "Restart the instance"
  PARAMETER "target"=<object-idenfier>
  ```

  - Change Priority

  ```xml
  OPERATION "Change priority"
  PARAMETER "target"=<object-idenfier>, "change-priority"=<change-value>
  ```

- **Alert**

  - Send an email

  ```xml
  OPERATION "send an email"
  PARAMETER "recipient"=<employee-identifier>, "message"=<text>
  ```

### How-to

1. Import CFD and AFD files.
2. Run _Synthetic Information System_ plug-in on ProM framework.
3. With that being one of the input, you can initiate the AOPM plug-in. This time, you don't have to configure a filepath for an event stream. This process is done internally.
4. Configure constraints by selecting a constraint formula and specifying when to monitor it.
5. Configure actions by selecting an action formula and specifying when to execute it.
6. Run it.
7. The gateway implemented in the information system automatically translates the action instance stream into transactions and updates the information system.

## 4. Supported constraints

Below is the list of constraints this plug-in supports. We explain the syntax to be used when defining constraint formulas for each type of constraints.

## Instance-level

#### Control-flow

- **Existence**: Limits occurrence of an activity.

  - Syntax: ```"Non-existence",activity-id```
  - Example: "check availability" do not occur in the instance
    - ```"Non-existence","check availability"```
- **Bounded Existence**: Limits the number of times an activity must occur.
  - Syntax: ```"Bounded-Existence" activity-id, num-execution```
  - Example: "check availability" must occur at least twice in the instance
    - ```"Bounded-Existence","check availability", 2```
- **Bounded Non-Existence**: Limits the number of times an activity must not occur.
  - Syntax: ```"Bounded-Non-Existence" activity-id, num-execution```

- **Precedence**: Limits the occurrence of an activity in precedence over another activity.
  - Syntax: ```"Precedence" preceding-activity-id, condition-activity-id, num-execution```
  - Example: "placeorder" is preceded by "check availability" at least twice.
    - ```"Precedence","placeorder", "check availability",2```

### Time
